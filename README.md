# Notris
A Command Line implementation of Tetris, which was originally part of a puzzle/RPG game. Development of said game is suspended until I have the time to spare.
For now, I will focus on polishing Notris. 

Ideally it will fully conform to the Tetris Guidelines, https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Guideline.

TO DO:
* Edge-case issues with collision detection.
* Implement hi-scores and menu screen.

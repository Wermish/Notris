# Introduction
A Win32 Command Line implementation of Tetris, created using MSVC/C and the Console API.

I decided not to use a multimedia library so that I would have to create everything from scratch; my 'only' tools being a modern, well documented compiler and a modern, well documented OS. I decided to use Tetris as it is well known and also well documented (https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Guideline).
